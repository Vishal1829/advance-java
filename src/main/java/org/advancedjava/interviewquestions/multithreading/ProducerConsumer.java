3. Producer-Consumer Problem Using BlockingQueue
Problem: Implement a producer-consumer pattern where one thread produces numbers (1 to 5) and another consumes them.
Why Asked: Tests thread coordination with modern utilities.

Note: Output: (Order may vary slightly due to timing)

Explanation: BlockingQueue handles synchronization and blocking automatically (e.g., put() waits if full, take() waits if empty).

/*
What Does the Size (Capacity) Mean?
In new LinkedBlockingQueue<>(2), the 2 is the capacity of the queueâ€”the maximum number of elements
it can hold before it blocks the producer.
A BlockingQueue is a thread-safe queue that supports blocking operations:
put(): Adds an element; if the queue is full (at capacity), it blocks the producer until space is available.
take(): Removes an element; if the queue is empty, it blocks the consumer until an element is added.
By setting the capacity to 2, the queue can store up to 2 elements at any time.
